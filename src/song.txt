Backburner
NIKI

I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling
You sound sad and alone and you're stalling
And for once, I don't care about what you want
As long as we keep talking (as long as we're talking)

I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched
Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that
Well, whether we're free of will or predestined
Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now
Hope He doesn't strike me down (strike me down)

The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me
The way you should be too
But you bring them up
Along with how much I fucking miss you

Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die
You'd think I'd be a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner

Backburner
Your backburner
Your backburner
Your backburner

It's pathetic, but at least you are too
I don't know what to do
I don't like anyone except sometimes you
And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy

You look ugly when you cry
But I'm the one you think to call
How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time?
After everything you put me through
I somehow still believe in you, oh-oh

But I know in a week or so
You'll fade away again
And I wish that I cared
Hey, are you still there?
Good

Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time
I thought I was a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind, guess I won't ever mind
Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride
Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes
(It's their fault that)
I'll always be in your corner
'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burnin' on your backburner, oh-oh
(Backburner, your backburner)

And I know that it's sad that I settle for the backburner, oh-oh (your backburner)
(Your backburner, your backburner)
Guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner, oh-oh (your backburner)
(Backburner, your backburner)
As long as you still think of me, oh, oh-oh (backburner, backburner)

The word “backburner” comes from the idea of putting a pot on a stove’s back burner, where it’s still there but not being given immediate attention.
So when someone says they put something “on the backburner”, it means:
They are delaying it.
It’s a lower priority compared to other tasks.
They may return to it later, but it’s not urgent right now.

Example:
“I had to put my personal project on the backburner while I focus on exams.”

Do you want me to also explain the difference between "backburner" as a noun vs. the phrase "put on the backburner"?
